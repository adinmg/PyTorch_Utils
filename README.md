# PyTorch-Utils

## Description

This repository contains a collection of PyTorch modules and utilities designed to simplify data loading, training, saving, etc.

## Modules

### data_setup.py
Contains `create_dataloaders` for creating PyTorch DataLoaders specifically for image classification data.

### engine.py
Contains `train()` function for training and validating a PyTorch model.

### helper_functions.py

- `plot_decision_boundary()`: Function for visualizing decision boundaries.
- `plot_predictions()`: Function for plotting predictions.
- `plot_loss_curves()`: Function for plotting loss curves.
- `predict_and_store()`: Function for making predictions and storing results.
- `set_seeds()`: Function for setting random seeds.
- `predict_and_store()`: Function for making predictions and storing results.

### utils.py
Contains a function for saving a PyTorch model.
